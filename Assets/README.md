# Unit 05 CSS Day planner

In this assignment, I had to modify an html file to display each hour from 9AM-5PM as well as text boxes and a functioning save button.


# HTML & CSS

I noticed when looking at the css file and the different tag classes that they werent all already on the html file which I figured out meant we had to set up the tags and classes to line up with the css tags to save time with formatting.  At first, I had the save button set as a div tag but I remembered back to lass weeks homework assignment where I used a button tag instead to make it function as a button.


# JavaScript

It took me a little while to figure out how to set up the clock to display on the page.
